# Coffee-Shop-Daily-Revenue-Prediction
Comprehensive analysis of 2,000 daily revenue records from a coffee shop operation from Kaggle(Coffee Shop Daily Revenue Prediction Dataset). Using Cluade Cowork End-to-End Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling. The objective was to identify the key factors driving daily revenue such as Number of Customers Per Day, Average Order Value, Marketing Spend Per Day, etc. and build a predictive model to support strategic decision-making. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

Category 1: CO₂ Capture

Category 2: CO₂ Recovery

Category 3: Capture vs. Recovery Gap 

The data cleansing process followed a structured 4-phase approach: Assess, Clean, Validate, and Document. Each phase is detailed below with specific actions taken and their rationale.

# Dataset Description
The data model comprises six tables capturing CO₂ capture and recovery performance across experimental runs, cycles, and efficiency metrics, totaling 363,330 records.

## Tables
* CO₂ Capture & Recovery: Main fact table with raw experimental data (CO₂ capture in kg, CO₂ recovery in kg, run number).
* CO₂ Capture Cumulatives: Aggregated table tracking cumulative CO₂ captured over time (cumulative value in kg).
*	CO₂ Recovery Cumulatives: Aggregated table tracking cumulative CO₂ recovered over time (cumulative value in kg).
* CO₂ Capture Efficiency: Measure table for capture efficiency calculations (percentage).
* CO₂ Recovery Efficiency: Measure table for recovery efficiency calculations (percentage).
* CO₂ Capture Efficiency (by Cycle): Helper table for cycle-level efficiency breakdown (% captured, cycle number).
* CO₂ Capture Recovery (by Cycle): Helper table for cycle-level recovery breakdown (% recovery, cycle number).

# Executive Summary
## Overview of Findings
Across five experimental runs, the CO₂ capture system demonstrated consistently high capture efficiency but variable recovery performance depending on sorbent generation and configuration. Zeolite-based runs showed significantly lower capture volumes, while Gen 1 sorbent runs dominated total throughput.

* Total CO₂ captured across all runs reached 449.80 kg, with Run 1 Gen 1 contributing the highest volume at 173.89 kg.
*	CO₂ Capture Efficiency averaged 99.54%, indicating near-complete adsorption performance across cycles.
*	Total CO₂ recovered was 70.54 kg, reflecting an overall Recovery Efficiency of only 41.41%.
*	Run 3 (Zeolite only) recorded the lowest capture and recovery, suggesting limited sorbent effectiveness under tested conditions.
*	Significantly detected Gen 2 sorbent inefficiency normally it should be better than Gen 1 and determined it as the root cause of operational issues, and drove cost savings by discontinuing its production.

# Insights 
## Category 1: CO₂ Capture 
*	Capture volume varied significantly across runs, ranging from 5.86 kg (Run 3 Zeolite) to 173.89 kg (Run 1 Gen 1).
*	Runs using Gen 1 sorbent alone or in combination consistently outperformed Zeolite-only configurations.
*	Run 2 Gen 1 + Gen 2 by half-half capture around 164.26 kg. It should be better than pure Gen 1
*	The high capture efficiency (~99.54%) across most cycles confirms the adsorption stage is operating effectively.

## Category 2: CO₂ Recovery 
*	Run 3 (Zeolite) recorded the lowest total recovery at 1.16 kg, while Run 2 Gen 1+2 achieved the highest at 20.35 kg.
*	Recovery efficiency showed high variability across cycles, with values ranging from near 0% to 100% within individual runs.
*	The scatter pattern in the Recovery Efficiency chart suggests desorption performance is sensitive to cycle conditions and sorbent type.

## Category 3: Capture vs. Recovery Gap
*	A significant gap exists between capture (449.80 kg) and recovery (70.54 kg), indicating that while CO₂ is effectively adsorbed, a large portion is not successfully desorbed and collected.
*	Optimizing the desorption phase particularly may be key to improving overall system efficiency.

# Recommendations
*	Desorption Optimization: Given the large gap between capture efficiency (99.54%) and recovery efficiency (41.41%), further investigation into the desorption phase is critical. Temperature swing parameters and heating duration should be systematically varied to improve CO₂ release from the sorbent bed.
*	Scaling for Higher Throughput: Run 1 and Run 2 demonstrated the highest capture volumes (173.89 kg and 164.26 kg respectively). These configurations should be prioritized as the baseline for scaled-up pilot testing, with attention to maintaining efficiency at larger sorbent bed volumes.
*	Run Monitoring & Real-Time Diagnostics: Deploy cycle-level monitoring dashboards to detect early signs of sorbent degradation or performance drops, enabling proactive intervention before efficiency losses accumulate across long runs.
